# FLL

First Lego League is an educational program where students (Age 9-14)  get to build and program an autonomous LEGO robot as well as develop a solution to a real world problem in order to challenge their engineering and science skills.  By signing up with the Monta Vista Robotics Team, students will be placed onto a team of 4-6 students and will be provided with coaches from Monta Vista in order to guide them in their learning process. Teams will also receive a table, an EV3 Kit to use, and the game board + materials. Each FLL team meets for approximately 6 hours per week from September to November (or February if they win!)  Each student will need to pay $100 in order to help cover the necessary supplies to participate.  If you're want to register your child, please fill out the form below!
