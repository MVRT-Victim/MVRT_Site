There are three easy steps to become a member of MVRT. The deadline for completing all parts is (TBD) in late September.

-----

####1. Fill out the [online application][1].

<br>

####2. Print out, complete, and sign the [MVRT Medical Form][2].

> Turn forms in to any MVRT Officer, or stop by at one of our meetings.

####3. Pay the $135 membership donation (or $160 with a polo).

> Checks can be made out to "MV ASB", with "MVRT" in the memo, and turned in to any officer.

If you have any personal financial issues with paying the membership fee, please talk to us!
We are more than willing to accommodate to your situation and we donâ€™t want money to be a reason for your not joining.
